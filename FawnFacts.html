    <div class= fawnfacts>
    <p>Get to know Fawn with some <i>Fawn Facts</i>!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fawn's birthday is estimated to be in July. His inner circle believe the vet's estimate is accurate, as he seems like a classic Cancer sun.
                <img src="images/pumpkinsweater.jpg" class="pumpkin" alt="A carefree Fawn in a pumpkin patterned sweater in a silly upside down pose."></li>
            <li>Fawn likes to be warm. If he could, he would hibernate from mid-October to mid-April, but in lieu of that likes to be in a thick sweater and under a blanket at all times. </li>
            <li>Fawn's favorite tv show is Gilmore Girls. The hyper-chatty brunettes remind him of his mom and are comforting to him. </li>
            <li>Fawn loves to go into coffee shops during his weekend walks, but hates to wait in line for coffee. He might think the point of coffee shops are to receive ear scratches from new friends? </li>
            <li>Fawn is a dead head. He especially loves to vibe to China Cat Sunflower and Dark Star on a Saturday morning. </li>
            <li>Then, on Sunday nights, Fawn likes to listen to the full of Troye Sivan's <i>Something to Give Each Other</i>, no skips. Fawn's mom introduced him to Troy Sivan because she wanted him to have positive male rolemodels. </li>
            <li>A definitive ranking of Fawn's favorite sweaters 
                <ol>
                    <li>Red hoodie with sherpa lining, detailing, and pockets. </li>
                    <li>Teal hoodie that looks like something a boy in a feel-good family movie centered on a youth sports team would shout "Mom, you're ruining my life!" while wearing, before ultimately realizing how much he appreciates his mom. </li>
                    <li>Orange pumpkin patterned sweater. His first ever sweater!</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Fawn has more nicknames than can be listed here. They include: FawnyFeeny, Mr. Fawn, SHAKES, Llama Llama, Brother Fawn, Monsieur Le Faun, Baby Bub, Little Love, Prince Cuddlebug... 
                <img src="images/hoodie.png" class="hoodie" alt="Fawn in a teal hoodie looking frazzled"></li>
            <li>Fawn loves to hear the sound of a cutting board! Special treats for him include broccoli stem, carrot sticks, and apple slices. </li>
            <li>The ultimate special occasion food? If Fawn's mom makes salmon for dinner, she'll cut off a little piece for him. Fawn goes bananas for salmon!</li>
