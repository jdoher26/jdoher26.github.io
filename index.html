        <h3>Rescue dog living with my mom in Brooklyn.</h3>
        <h3>Seeking to be your inspiration to foster and adopt!</h3>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my website! I am a seven year old rescue dog who has been living with my mom for three years now. When she adopted me, I was very fearful of most things. Thanks to training and lots of love, I've become a trusting and happy pup. Please explore! There's fun stuff, as well as my appeal for why you should consider fostering.</p>
