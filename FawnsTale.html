    <h1>Fawn's Tale:</h1>
    <h3>A maniFAWNsto on the joys of fostering and rescuing</h3>
    <p>The summer of 2022, I was in the position which countless shelter animals find themselves in each year: stuck in an overcrowded building, stressed due to limited space and too much stimulus. The shelter workers are dedicated and do their best to help us, but they have too few resources for the number of animals who come through their system. I wasn't a puppy anymore, and the majority of adopters want a puppyface. I also wasn't in the best shape: skinny, thin fur, and often giving stress signals. In July of 2022 I had the opportunity to be taken from my Kentucky shelter by a New York City rescue organization called Louie's Legacy. But then bad news came my way. The foster who had committed to taking me fell through. Louie's was scrambling to find me a new foster, because the sad reality was, if I didn't make it out that month, I was going to be placed on the euthanasia list. </p>

    <p>Thankfully, I had a hero in the wings, waiting to swoop into my life: my Auntie Krista! My Auntie volunteered often with Louie's and her pup, Ren, was a rescue from Louie's. When she saw the news that my foster fell through, she knew just the person to get involved. When my Auntie adopted my cousin Ren into the family, she introduced my mom into a life shared with canines, and sparked my mom's passion for fostering. My mom had just helped another foster dog get placed, and was not planning on fostering again until the fall, but Auntie Krista let my mom know about the urgency of my situation and even helped get a temp foster in place for me, since my mom wasn't in town on the day I was transported to New York.</p>

    <p>My first week in Brooklyn was scary. My mom had to take me onto the subway- crowded!- and her neighborhood is full of other dogs. I was so scared of other dogs at first, and my walks were hard. But my mom and her whole family were determined to help me grow. Soon I put on a little weight, and my coat grew a little thicker and softer. Instead of being afraid of every dog I saw, I became curious and started to make friends. I learned I didn't have to be afraid because my mom wouldn't let anything happen to me. It's colder in New York than where I grew up, but she bought me a few sweaters, and soon I was a real city pup, exploring parks, hanging out at coffee shops and bar patios, and traveling all over the city to visit my friends.

    <p>My mom wasn't expecting to adopt that year, but the summer of 2022 ended up being tough for her too. Her Granny passed away shortly after I came to her apartment, and we ended up spending August with her parents and sisters. I built a special bond with my mom's mom- now my precious Grandma!- during that time. After a few months of trying to help me find the right permanent family, she realized that I had already become part of her family, and that the universe was telling her I was the right dog at the right time. </p>

    <p>When people tell my mom they're interested in getting a dog or cat, she always really recommends spending some time fostering first. Saying goodbye to a foster friend can be hard, but fostering taught my mom to reframe that bittersweet moment. Every time a foster of her's was adopted, she had helped a family find their new best friend, she had given a dog a soft place to land before starting their new life, and she opened space in the shelter for another dog that might otherwise be at risk. And that made the moment more sweet than bitter. Plus, she knows that the dogs she fostered before me, while lovely, weren't right for her lifestyle. Fostering allowed her to recognize what type of dog best suited her life's rhythms. When she graduates from grad school and has a little more time in her days, she hopes to foster again. I look forward to helping new friends find their families the way I was helped in finding mine. </p>
    <br>
    <p>And now here we are, two anxious but friendly creatures, living in Brooklyn. I come with her to the office, I watch over her boyfriend while she's at school, and on the weekends we take long walks, spend time with our family and friends, and do her homework together. It's more coding than I thought I'd have in my future when I was just a shelter dog in Kentucky, but hey- I'll take it! </p>

    <h2>Ways to help shelter dogs:</h2>
    <h4>Fawn is a very lucky dog. Several thousands of shelter animals just like him are euthanized each year. They are just as deserving of life and love!</h4>

            <li>Consider ADOPTING rather than shopping from breeders. Even when breeders strive to be ethical in the business, there is too much supply vs demand of adoptable pets.</li>
            <li>Be open to fostering!! People always say "I couldn't foster. I'd get too attached! I'd want to adopt every dog!" For those who have experienced fostering, this is always frustrating to hear. Of course, sometimes people who foster develop a bond with a foster animal. However, fostering is about the greater good beyond personal attachment or the need to possess every wonderful creature you meet. Get a little attached, maybe get even a little heartbroken the first time you say goodbye to a foster. But know that your heart has the capacity to love and let go and love again. The fosters you meet along the way will enrich your life, even if you are only together for a short time. Consider getting in touch with your local shelter.</li>
            <li>Donations help rescue organizations provide food, medical care, and shelter to dogs. Animal shelters and rescues both tend to be strapped for resources and can use volunteer labor or donations. Consider sharing your time or resources, if possible for you. <a href="https://louieslegacy.org/">Louie's Legacy</a>, who saved Fawn and Ren, is extremely dear to our hearts!</li>
